	<p class="has-text-justified">The second ICCP Summer School on Computational Imaging will take place July 11&ndash;12, 2026, immediately before the ICCP 2026 main conference, at Princeton University. There will be registration options available for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as non-student researchers from academia and industry (new this year). As in 2025, the school will emphasize <em>hands-on</em> courses on current research topics in computational imaging and computational photography.</p>

	<p class="has-text-justified">We will update this page in early 2026 to provide more information. For any questions, please contact the Summer School Chairs (Katie Bouman and Ioannis Gkioulekas) at <a href="mailto:iccp2026school@gmail.com">iccp2026school@gmail.com</a>.</p>
