### By plane

The airport is a major hub serving domestic and international destinations. From Newark, you can take NJ Transit's Northeast Corridor Line to Princeton Junction (approximately 1 hour), then transfer to the Princeton Branch "Dinky" (5-minute ride) to reach Princeton campus. Alternatively, taxi or ride-share services take approximately 50-70 minutes depending on traffic.

From Philadelphia, you can take SEPTA to 30th Street Station, then transfer to NJ Transit or Amtrak to Princeton Junction (total time approximately 2 hours), followed by the Dinky to campus. Taxi or ride-share services take approximately 1 hour depending on traffic.

* **Other airports**. John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in New York are farther options but offer extensive flight connections. Both are approximately 60-90 miles from Princeton and require 1.5-2.5 hours by car or public transportation.
